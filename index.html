    <center><h2> THE PROBLEM </h2></center>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <center><p class="problem"> A likely future for the U.S. in the years 2020 and beyond is a country split between the aging baby boom still with substantial political, economic, and social power, and a young, fast-growing multi-cultural population with far less political and economic clout. Beyond the clear demographic trends, the starting points for this divide can be seen in the growing generation gap that can be measured in the attitudes and behavior of Americans today.
