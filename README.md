Used html,css, and js to make a website which bridges the generation gap and encourages students to to become activists to improve society

Our mission at FLAME is to bridge the generation inequality gap and encourage students to become activists to improve society. We begin the eradication of generation inequality by providing Gen-Z students with resources to hold activism events in their communities and directly connect with their congressional representitves to catalyze change in their community.

With two other girls, I made this website while competing at Anita Hacks 2019.  I was in creating the Home, Connect, and Sponsors pages using HTML,CSS, and JS.
